# Important note

I got an issue with installing packages from your package-lock.json file due to the authentication error (*Error 401 on GET "https://reach-apps-703116017392.d.codeartifact.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com..."*). As I didnâ€™t have access to the specified address and it was indicated as the package location for some packages in the initial package-lock, I have generated a new package-lock.json file and installed default packages.

## Setup

Clone this repo and run `npm install`.

### Tests

Run `npm test`.
